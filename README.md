# Chiter
A crate designed for doing things with memory with the target usage being game hacking, reverse engineering and similiar which is fully written in Rust.

# My Modifications
Fixed bugs which caused unreliable, slow or even completely missed data.

I also changed some of the api to be more rust-like and predictable.

Most of the crate however is exactly the same as the original `chiter` crate and as such deserves the recognition and thanks for the base.
